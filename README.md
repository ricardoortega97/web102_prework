## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

It has been a while since I used JavaScript, so I was rusty with the project and forgot the basics. 
Understanding Array.prototype with how to set the callback for the two arguments was slightly hard to process and took a while to work. 
One thing that made me struggle was the filter functions created only when the eventListener was called, as when I tried to call it in the console, it seemed that the function was not defined(it was not made until I clicked the button to filter). I made the operation filter to be called outside of the function as well as it was needed later on in the last part of the session. I plan to practice more with spread operators, and destructing since it felt the most challenging part of the work.
